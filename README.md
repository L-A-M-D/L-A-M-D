- 👋 Hi, I’m Lucas Matos!
- 👀 I’m interested in Coding, Gaming, and building computers!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning PostgreSQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, REACT, NODE.JS, and some other technical stuff!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on more projects that are related to rockets, but I'd like to expand my knowledge in all the branches of technology, mainly in cybersecurity.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I built my first pc when I was 13 years old, but my parents wouldn't let me build it, so i had to get some one to "build it for me", when it was really just me telling the person what to do...
